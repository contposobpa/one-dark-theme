The Promise Part 3 picks up where Part 2 left off, with Aang and Zuko facing off against each other over the fate of Yu Dao, a Fire Nation colony in the Earth Kingdom that has become a multicultural city. Aang has promised to end the Fire Nation's occupation of the Earth Kingdom, while Zuko has vowed to protect his people's interests and rights. Meanwhile, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Suki, and the rest of Team Avatar try to prevent a full-scale war from breaking out between the two sides. Along the way, they encounter old friends and foes, such as Iroh, Mai, Ty Lee, Azula, Smellerbee, Longshot, and Jet.
 
The Promise Part 3 delivers a satisfying conclusion to the series, with plenty of action, humor, drama, and romance. The book explores themes such as identity, loyalty, friendship, and compromise, as well as the challenges of rebuilding a world after a long and devastating conflict. The book also sets up the stage for the next series, Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Search, which follows Zuko's quest to find his mother.
 
The art by Gurihiru is stunning and faithful to the original show's style and tone. The colors are vibrant and expressive, and the characters are drawn with emotion and personality. The action scenes are dynamic and fluid, and the backgrounds are detailed and immersive. The book also includes some bonus art and sketches by Gurihiru and Yang at the end.
 
Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Promise Part 3 is a must-read for fans of the show and comics alike. It is a worthy continuation of the beloved story of Avatar Aang and his friends, and a testament to the power of storytelling and imagination.
